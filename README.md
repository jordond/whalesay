**WhaleSay** is a app for translating English text or speech into the Whale language "Whalese".  Visit [whalesay](https://whalesay.ca) for more information!

## Highlights

- Android application
  - Soon to be on the Google Play store!
- Beautiful
- Translates text or speech
  - Speech requires the Microphone permission
- FREE & NO ads!

This project is inspired by [Talk To Whales](https://talktowhales.com/). Thanks to [Arthur Sousa](http://arthursousa.com/) for his inspiration.

## Permissions

- Required:
  - Internet: Used to talk to our science servers to translate your English into Whalese.
  - Access Network State: Used to determine if you have internet. (Internet is required to translate!)
- Optional:
  - Microphone: Required _if_ you wan't to use the Speech to Text feature, you can opt-out and use the Text only functionality.

## Installation

WhaleSay is not yet available on the Play store yet, as it is not complete.  You can however download the latest `.apk` from [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/worldturtlemedia/whalesay)

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome!

This repository uses [ktlint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint) git hook, so every time you `git commit` it will run to make sure your code fits the style guide.

I recommend running `./gradlew ktlintFormat` before commiting so it can auto-fix some common problems.

## Note

Our "scientists" are actually frauds and don't exist.  WhaleSay actually uses Googles Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech Cloud API's to generate the "Whalese".  Shhh don't tell anyone ;)
